PREPARATION

you'll need a MIPS compiler w/ support for a little-endian R3000 (MIPS I architecture)
it will also need to be built w/ newlib

recommended tuple to use: `mipsel-elf`

by all means feel free to patch out the libstdc++ check where it complains and dies because it doesn't recognise the tuple

CONFIGURING

look at `CONFIG.PSX` for your `config.sh` line

BUILDING
